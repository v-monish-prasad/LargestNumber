Largest Number

Given an array A of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

Example Input

Input 1:
A = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]

Input 2:
A = [2, 3, 9, 0]

Example Output

Output 1:
"9534330"

Output 2:
"9320"
